<h1>About Mongrel2</h1>

<p>Mongrel2 is an <em>application</em>, <em>language</em>, and <em>network architecture</em> <b>agnostic</b> web server.  The goal is to create a web server specifically designed for web <b>applications</b> over serving files.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Programming language agnostic design<b> that lets you use whatever language you want, even to configure and manage it.
    </b></b>
    </li>
    <li><b>Designed to handle HTTP, Flash XMLSockets, or WebSockets, or Long Polling</b> on the same socket transparently, and then route messages from those <b>to <a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>, HTTP, or raw socket</b> backends.
    </li>
    <li><b>Break the strict request/response mapping and let you translate one request or message into multiple backends</b> to produce a more complex response. This will let you create scalable architectures using any backend language you want.
    </li>
    <li><b>Uses a MVC style configuration design, with sqlite3 as the "Model" and Python scripts as the "View".</b>  There's a m2sh program that lets you manage the server, it's configuration, and logs about configuration activity.
    </li>
    <li><b>Use the proven and rock solid Mongrel HTTP Parser</b> that many other web application servers use.  There have been very few security flaws in this parser, and it actively blocks many attacks due to its design.
    </li>
    <li><b>Use the latest event systems (poll, epoll, kqueue)</b> but rather than force you to understand async events, it will use a <b>fast context switching coroutine system</b> based on ucontext or assembler.
    </li>
    <li><b>Support all of the usual web server features,</b> but it will defer to being designed specifically for applications over high-speed file serving.  Since Mongrel2 will be written in C it should do files pretty well too, but easy application architectures and operations support will come first.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Download</h2>

<p>We are currently crafting a release process, but for now you can get the latest source
download from:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/static/mongrel2-1.0beta.zip">mongrel2-1.0beta.zip</a></li>
    <li><a href="/static/mongrel2-1.0beta.tar.bz2">mongrel2-1.0beta.tar.bz2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These files will be generated periodically, and contain a directory with the date/time they were made,
the repository version number, and the full checkout.  As we get closer to release we'll have a better
directory structure.
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Mongrel2 is a very well documented piece of software, as we think great docs will make you
more productive and get you running.  The documentation is written to be easy to read, pack a lot
of information in a small space, and cover everything you need without going crazy on minute details.
Currently we have:<p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/wiki?name=GettingStarted">GettingStarted</a> a crash course in getting up and running.</li>
    <li><a href="/doc/tip/docs/manual/book.wiki">The Mongrel2 Manual (HTML)</a> is a complete manual covering everything from getting started, to writing your first handlers.</li>
    <li><a href="/static/book-final.pdf">The Mongrel2 Manual (PDF)</a> grab this if you want better formatting.</li>
    <li><a href="/wiki?name=DesignCriticisms">DesignCriticisms</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>IRC and Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>I reserve the right to boot anyone I want off these for being obnoxious, and I arbitrarily define "obnoxious" however I want.</p>
