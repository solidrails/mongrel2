\chapter*{Introduction}

Mongrel2 is a web server.  HTTP requests come in, HTTP responses go out.
Request, response.  There is nothing revolutionary or extravagant in what
Mongrel2 does with a browser, apart from supporting fancy asynchronous socket
protocols.  To the browser, Mongrel2 is just this nice web server that has
WebSockets and Flash Sockets in it.  That's it.

What makes Mongrel2 special is how it satisfies these requests in a {\bf
language agnostic} and {\bf asynchronous} way using a {\bf simple messaging
protocol} to talk to {\bf applications} not just serve files.  Mongrel2 is also
designed to be incredibly easy to {\bf automatically manage} it as part of your
infrastructure.

Other web servers do some of these things, but they either do them in a bastardized
way or not all of them at once.  Plenty of language specific web servers like Node.js
and Jetty have asynchronous operation, but then they're not language agnostic
\footnote{Who the hell wants to code Javascript all day?  Yuck.}.  Other web servers
will let you talk to any language as a backend, but they insist on using HTTP
proxying or FastCGI which is {\bf not} friendly to asynchronous operations.

As you'll see in the next section, Mongrel2 tries to get these features right by
using the right algorithms and technology to make them coexist.
