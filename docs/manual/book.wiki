  "x1-2000"></a>Preface</h2><!--l. 3-->

  <p class="noindent">This manual will tell you about the most
  awesome webserver on the planet: Mongrel2. It is written for
  people with a sense of humor who want to get things done with
  Mongrel2. That means if you&rsquo;re an operations professional,
  software developer, hacker, or just curious it&rsquo;s for you.
  However, if you&rsquo;re too serious and think &rdquo;flowery
  language&rdquo; (aka good entertaining writing) does not belong
  in your software manuals then you should just go read the source
  code and save everyone a huge headache dealing with you. 
  <!--l. 11-->

  <p class="indent">In case you haven&rsquo;t figured it out, this
  book will be fun and slightly obnoxious. That&rsquo;s not
  intended to insult you, but just to keep you interested so that
  you want to read it.

  <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-3000" name=
  "x1-3000"></a>Typography</h3><!--l. 18-->

  <p class="noindent">Usually the people running the web can be
  divided into three types of people: Steves, Edsgers, and Knuths. 
  <!--l. 21-->

  <p class="indent">The Steves think that the entire internet
  should be a wonderful user experience where all pages are crafted
  with pixel perfect fonts with high gloss visuals and coated with
  the most happy happy joy joy of all possible experiences. To them
  design is paramount and actual stability isn&rsquo;t important
  unless it interferes with design. The Steves of the internet
  think the Edsgers of internet are destroying the universe with
  things like &rdquo;functionality&rdquo;, &rdquo;security&rdquo;,
  and &rdquo;stability&rdquo;. Just like the real Steve Jobs, they
  would rather everything look fantastic and then use awesome
  marketing to cover up any technical flaws. <!--l. 31-->

  <p class="indent">The Edsgers feel that the internet is
  completely unsafe and until it is a fully curate and crafted set
  of academic peer reviewed papers it will be a festering pile of
  dung. To the Edsgers the world is dangerous and only a truly
  paranoid attitude toward security and stability will ensure that
  it becomes safe. They want every single piece of software to
  reject all reality and be crafted from nothing but pure
  mathematics, and hate the fact that the Steves want to run around
  painting the world with useless frivolous colors and words and
  things that lead to ambiguity and happiness. <!--l. 40-->

  <p class="indent">The typography in this book, and the entire
  project, is for the Knuths of the world. I like to think of the
  Knuths as the practical yet professional types with a light sense
  of humor. They are the ones who are getting things done while
  still balancing between great typography and solid bug free
  functionality. They aren&rsquo;t zealots but practical straight
  forward type of people. <!--l. 47-->

  <p class="indent">That is why this book is written in TeX and why
  it uses whatever fonts TeX uses.

  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class=
  "titlemark">Chapter&nbsp;1</span><br>
  <a id="x1-40001" name="x1-40001"></a>Introduction</h2><!--l. 3-->

  <p class="noindent">Mongrel2 is a web server. HTTP requests come
  in, HTTP responses go out. Request, response. There is nothing
  revolutionary or extravagant in what Mongrel2 does with a
  browser, apart from supporting fancy asynchronous socket
  protocols. To the browser, Mongrel2 is just this nice web server
  that has WebSockets and Flash Sockets in it. That&rsquo;s it. 
  <!--l. 9-->

  <p class="indent">What makes Mongrel2 special is how it satisfies
  these requests in a <span class="pplri7t-">language</span>
  <span class="pplri7t-">agnostic</span> and <span class=
  "pplri7t-">asynchronous</span> way using a <span class=
  "pplri7t-">simple messaging protocol</span> to talk to
  <span class="pplri7t-">applications</span> not just serve files.
  Mongrel2 is also designed to be incredibly easy to <span class=
  "pplri7t-">automatically</span> <span class=
  "pplri7t-">manage</span> it as part of your infrastructure. 
  <!--l. 15-->

  <p class="indent">Other web servers do some of these things, but
  they either do them in a bastardized way or not all of them at
  once. Plenty of language specific web servers like Node.js and
  Jetty have asynchronous operation, but then they&rsquo;re not
  language agnostic <span class="footnote-mark"><a href=
  "book-final2.html#fn1x2"><sup class=
  "textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4001f1" name=
  "x1-4001f1"></a>. Other web servers will let you talk to any
  language as a backend, but they insist on using HTTP proxying or
  FastCGI which is <span class="pplri7t-">not</span> friendly to
  asynchronous operations. <!--l. 22-->

  <p class="indent">Mongrel2 is the only web server I know of that
  actively tries to focus on these features as a cohesive whole.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1</span> <a id=
  "x1-50001.1" name="x1-50001.1"></a>Language Agnostic</h3>
  <!--l. 28-->

  <p class="noindent">The term &rdquo;language agnostic&rdquo; came
  from people who read about Mongrel2 in the early days and it
  means that Mongrel2 does <span class="pplri7t-">not</span> try to
  promote or any one language over any others. Mongrel2 does not
  care if you run a &rdquo;Python shop&rdquo; or if you&rsquo;re a
  die hard PHP fan or if you hate PHP and love only Ruby on Rails.
  Mongrel2 only knows about HTTP requests, HTTP responses, async
  messages, and getting them to your gear to meet those
  requirements. <!--l. 35-->

  <p class="indent">Language Agnosticism is the most important
  feature of Mongrel2 and it&rsquo;s entire purpose stems from the
  desire to reduce the amount of programming language religion in
  the world. Real people want to get things done, not wanker on
  which technology is the best or force other people to use their
  favorite toys. Instead Mongrel2 works to just be great for every
  language and make it easy to use what works best for a given
  problem. <!--l. 43-->

  <p class="noindent">

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2</span> <a id=
  "x1-60001.2" name="x1-60001.2"></a>Asynchronous</h3><!--l. 45-->

  <p class="noindent">Many web servers are
  &rdquo;asynchronous&rdquo; internally, and some others force you
  to know way too much about how they work internally to get
  anything done. What makes Mongrel2&rsquo;s version of
  asynchronous messaging different is it extends to <span class=
  "pplri7t-">outside</span> the Mongrel2 server. This is a powerful
  concept that even your backends can operate asynchronously using
  simple identification of connected clients. <!--l. 51-->

  <p class="indent">Other servers assume that every request is
  received by a browser, then sent to a backend, and then directly
  sent out to the client and that&rsquo;s it. Mongrel2 assumes that
  there is a connected client, and it sends requests to backends,
  but it makes no assumptions about how those backends respond to
  the clients. All it requires is that the backend application send
  messages addressed to the client and it will write them on the
  socket. <!--l. 58-->

  <p class="indent">Because of this design Mongrel2 can easily
  house both classic HTTP clients, keep-alive style HTTP client,
  chunked encoding responses, JSSockets, or WebSockets using the
  same code. <!--l. 63-->

  <p class="noindent">

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3</span> <a id=
  "x1-70001.3" name="x1-70001.3"></a>Message Protocol</h3>
  <!--l. 65-->

  <p class="noindent">In order to properly do asynchronous
  messaging in a language agnostic way, Mongrel2 needed a good base
  protocol that allowed for different messaging styles and worked
  with many different languages. HTTP proxying already does this,
  although it&rsquo;s not asynchronous at all. What gives Mongrel2
  its special powers is ZeroMQ, a language and transport mechanism
  agnostic messaging system that does <span class=
  "pplri7t-">not</span> require a centralized messaging server to
  operate. <!--l. 72-->

  <p class="indent">Using ZeroMQ lets Mongrel2 talk to a huge
  number of languages, operate within any kind of network
  architecture, and do it with a very simple communication model
  and API that most programmers can understand. <!--l. 77-->

  <p class="noindent">

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.4</span> <a id=
  "x1-80001.4" name="x1-80001.4"></a>Application Oriented</h3>
  <!--l. 79-->

  <p class="noindent">Web servers today are written as if it was
  still 1995 and all anyone needs to do is serve files, maybe some
  graphics. Today&rsquo;s web applications are not about serving
  files, they&rsquo;re about serving application logic <span class=
  "pplri7t-">and</span> doing it asynchronously. The advent of the
  bewildering numbers of ways to hack HTTP into an async messaging
  protocol<span class="footnote-mark"><a href=
  "book-final3.html#fn2x2"><sup class=
  "textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a id="x1-8001f2" name=
  "x1-8001f2"></a> is proof enough that the pressure is on for web
  server to be for applications with highly interactive interfaces.
  <!--l. 87-->

  <p class="indent">Mongrel2 can still serve files just fine. In
  fact, it&rsquo;s got very accurate and easy to understand file
  serving code. However, Mongrel2 will always be about
  applications. Fast scalable awesome asynchronous or synchronous
  applications that need to use languages that mere mortals can
  work with like PHP. If there&rsquo;s ever a choice, apps win.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.5</span> <a id=
  "x1-90001.5" name="x1-90001.5"></a>Automated Management</h3>
  <!--l. 94-->

  <p class="noindent">The language agnostic philosophy even extends
  to the configuration system where you can use any language you
  need to configure it and manage it, as long as the results are a
  SQLite3 database Mongrel2 can read and work with to run. There
  are great tools for managing this database already written in
  Python, but if you hate Python then you can write anything you
  want. <!--l. 100-->

  <p class="indent">This pattern is established with servers like
  Postfix, Exim, Sendmail, qmail, and others that convert
  configuration files to half-assed SQL databases. Mongrel2
  effectively adopts a Model-View-Controller design for its
  configuration system, the same way every web application is
  designed today. The Model is a SQlite3 database file, which any
  programming language can access. The Controller is a Mongrel2
  process that reads this file and sets itself up accordingly. 
  <!--l. 108-->

  <p class="indent">The View is a Python script called m2sh that
  gives you a command line &rdquo;UI&rdquo; to configure and setup
  the Mongrel2 sqlite model. It gives you commands for managing it,
  crafting configurations, looking at them, the works. 
  <!--l. 112-->

  <p class="indent">But most importantly, <span class=
  "pplri7t-">you can write your own</span>. You don&rsquo;t have to
  wait for a Mongrel2 developer to craft a configuration file
  parser for your favorite language, or use some hack job Nagios
  Perl junk to automate or scan it. It&rsquo;s SQlite3 with a solid
  simple schema and well written Python code showing you how it
  works. <!--l. 118-->

  <p class="indent">Nothing stops you from automating the hell out
  of Mongrel2 with that. <!--l. 121-->

  <p class="noindent">

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.6</span> <a id=
  "x1-100001.6" name="x1-100001.6"></a>Using This Manual</h3>
  <!--l. 123-->

  <p class="noindent">This manual is intended to be fun to read, so
  probably the best way to use it is to actually <span class=
  "pplri7t-">read it</span>. <!--l. 126-->

  <p class="indent">I know, revolutionary right. I mean, who has
  time to read and learn about something these days. You just want
  to get in there and get whatever problem you have done. Now! No
  time for words. You just want a straight dump right into your
  brain so that you are able to solve all your problems instantly
  and screw all this talking. <!--l. 131-->

  <p class="indent">You ever ask yourself if this attitude about
  not wanting to read and learn is possibly the reason you always
  get stuck in emergencies with no time to read and learn? 
  <!--l. 135-->

  <p class="indent">Something to think about. <!--l. 137-->

  <p class="indent">My recommendation is that you go through every
  page of this manual and do the stuff in it. Even if you think you
  won&rsquo;t need something, because you&rsquo;re not a
  programmer, or you&rsquo;re not in operations, you should learn
  it. Doing so will make the parts you do need clearer and give you
  better ideas for later.

  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class=
  "titlemark">Chapter&nbsp;2</span><br>
  <a id="x1-110002" name="x1-110002"></a>Installing</h2><!--l. 3-->

  <p class="noindent">Mongrel2 is designed to build on most modern
  Unix systems, specifically Linux and Mac OSX. It is written in C
  (<span class="pplri7t-">not Ruby</span>) and uses fairly vanilla
  C and standard libraries, except for one piece that implements
  the internal coroutines. Other than this you should be able to
  compile and install Mongrel2 with nothing more than <span class=
  "pplri7t-">make all install</span> after you&rsquo;ve installed
  all the dependencies. <!--l. 10-->

  <p class="indent">Now, if when I said dependencies you started to
  groan at having to install software to use my software, well my
  friend, welcome to the future. You said you don&rsquo;t want
  people reinventing the wheel right? Great, that means you need to
  install software for my software to work. It&rsquo;s either that
  or wait 10 years for me to build everything from scratch like
  some arrogant jackass. <!--l. 17-->

  <p class="indent">We good now? Great, let&rsquo;s get started.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1</span> <a id=
  "x1-120002.1" name="x1-120002.1"></a>Install Dependencies</h3>
  <!--l. 21-->

  <p class="noindent">To get everything working you will need the
  following dependencies:

  <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize">GNU make (gmake).

    <li class="itemize"><a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a> for
    the messaging.

    <li class="itemize"><a href="http://python.org">Python 2.6</a>
    for the m2sh management and examples.

    <li class="itemize"><a href=
    "http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a> and make sure <span class=
    "pplri7t-">Python</span> has the ability to access SQLite3.

    <li class="itemize"><a href=
    "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute">distribute</a> and
    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/0.7.2">pip</a>.

    <li class="itemize"><a href=
    "http://github.com/ellisonbg/pyzmq">PyZMQ</a> for the examples.
  </ul><!--l. 32-->

  <p class="indent">If you install these things in this order, then
  everything should be good. Typically people run into problems if
  they do this out of order, for example trying to install Mongrel2
  before they have distribute and pip installed. <!--l. 36-->

  <p class="indent">Since every system is different it is difficult
  to tell you exactly how to install required packages for your OS,
  but here&rsquo;s how I did it on my computer: <!--l. 40-->

    <div class="quote">
      <!--l. 15-->

      <p class="noindent">When I first started talking about
      Mongrel2 I said I&rsquo;d store the configuration in SQLite
      and do a Model-View-Controller kind of design. Immediately
      people who can&rsquo;t read flipped out and though this meant
      they&rsquo;d be back in &rdquo;windows registry hell&rdquo;
      but with SQL as their only way to access it. They thought
      that they&rsquo;d be stuck writing configurations with SQL.
      That SQL couldn&rsquo;t possibly configure a web server. 
      <!--l. 21-->

      <p class="noindent">They were wrong on many levels. Nobody
      was <span class="pplri7t-">ever</span> going to make
      <span class="pplri7t-">anyone</span> use SQL. That was
      repeated over and over, but again, people don&rsquo;t read
      and love spreading FUD. The SQLite config database is nothing
      like the Windows Registry. No other web server really uses a
      true hierarchy, they just cram a relational model into a
      weirdo configuration format. The real goal was to make a web
      server that was easy to manage from <span class=
      "pplri7t-">any</span> language, and then give people a nice
      tool to get their job done without having to ever touch SQL.
      <span class="pplri7t-">EVER!</span> <!--l. 29-->

      <p class="noindent">In the end, what we got despite all this
      fear mongering is a bad ass configuration tool and a design
      that is simple, elegant, and works fantastic. If you read
      that Mongrel2 uses SQLite and though this was weird, well
      welcome to the future. Sometimes it&rsquo;s weird out here
      (even though, Postfix has been doing this for a decade or
      more).

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1</span> <a id=
  "x1-200003.1" name="x1-200003.1"></a>Model-View-Controller</h3>
  <!--l. 38-->

  <p class="noindent">When you hear Model-View-Controller you think
  about web applications. This is a design pattern where you place
  different concerns into different parts of your system and try
  not to mix them too much. For an interactive application, if you
  keep the part that stores data (Model) separated from the logic
  (Controller) and use another piece to display and interact with
  the user (View) then it&rsquo;s easier to change the system and
  adapt it over time to new features. <!--l. 44-->

  <p class="indent">The power of MVC is simply that these things
  really are separate orthogonal pieces that get ugly if
  they&rsquo;re mixed together. There&rsquo;s not math or theory
  that says why, just lots of experience has told us it&rsquo;s
  usually a bad idea. When you start mixing them you find out that
  it&rsquo;s hard to change for new requirements later because
  you&rsquo;ve sprinkled logic all over your web pages. Or you
  can&rsquo;t update your database because there&rsquo;s all these
  stored procedures that assume the tables are a certain way. 
  <!--l. 51-->

  <p class="indent">Mongrel2 needed a way to allow you to use
  various languages and tools to automate its configuration.
  Letting you automate your deployments is the entire point of the
  server. The idea was that if we gave you the Controller and the
  Model, then you can craft any <span class="pplri7t-">View</span>
  you wanted, and there&rsquo;s no better Model than a SQL database
  like SQLite. It&rsquo;s embeddable, easily accessed from C or any
  language, portable, small, fast enough, and full of all the
  features you need and then some. <!--l. 57-->

  <p class="indent">What you are doing when you use m2sh to
  configure a configuration for Mongrel2 is working with a View
  we&rsquo;ve given you to create a Model for the Mongrel2 server
  to work with. That&rsquo;s it, and you can create your own View
  if you want. It could be automated deployment scripts, a web
  interface, monitoring scripts, anything you need. <!--l. 62-->

  <p class="indent">The point is, if you just want to get Mongrel2
  up and running, then use m2sh. If you want to do more advanced
  stuff, then get into the configuration database schema and see
  what you can do. The structure of the database very closely
  matches Mongrel2&rsquo;s internal structure, so understanding
  that means you understand how Mongrel2 works. This is a vast
  improvement over other web servers like Apache where you&rsquo;ve
  got no idea why one stanza has to go in a particular place, or
  why information has to be duplicated. <!--l. 69-->

  <p class="indent">With Mongrel2 it&rsquo;s all right there.

  <p class="indent">Awesome right? Using just this one little

  <a id="x1-220003.2.1" name="x1-220003.2.1"></a>What The Hell Just
  Happened?</h4><!--l. 115-->

  <p class="noindent">You now have done nearly everything you can
  to a configuration, but you might not know exactly what&rsquo;s
  going on. Here&rsquo;s an explanation of what&rsquo;s going on
  behind the scenes: <!--l. 118-->

  <p class="indent">

  <ol class="enumerate1">
    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22002x1">When you did <span class=
    "pplri7t-">m2sh start</span> with the <span class=
    "pplri7t-">-sudo</span> option it actually runs <span class=
    "pplri7t-">sudo</span> <span class="pplri7t-">mongrel2
    tests/config.sqlite localhost</span> to start the server.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22004x2">Mongrel2 is now running
    in the background as a daemon process, just like a regular
    server however what it did was chroot to the current directory
    and then drop privileges so that they match the owner of that
    directory (you). Use <span class="pplri7t-">ps aux</span> to
    take a look.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22006x3">With Mongrel2 running you
    can look in the logs/error.log file to see what it said. It
    should be a bunch of debug logging but check out the messages,
    nice and detailed.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22008x4">Next you did a soft
    reload with <span class="pplri7t-">m2sh reload</span> and you
    should notice that your mongrel2 process was able to load the
    new config <span class="pplri7t-">without restarting</span>.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22010x5">However, there&rsquo;s a
    slight bug that doesn&rsquo;t do the reload until the next
    request is served, that&rsquo;s what the <span class=
    "pplri7t-">curl http://localhost:8080/</span> was for.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22012x6">Now that you can see this
    reload work in the <span class="pplb7t-">logs/error.log</span>
    you used <span class="pplri7t-">m2sh running</span> to see if
    it&rsquo;s running. This command is just reading the config
    database to find out where the PID file is (<span class=
    "pplb7t-">run/mongrel2.pid</span>) and then checking if that
    process is running.

    <li class="enumerate" id="x1-22014x7">Finally, you tell
    mongrel2 to stop, and since it dropped privileges to be owned
    by you, you can do that without having to use sudo.
  </ol><!--l. 137-->

  <p class="indent">All of this is happening by reading the
  <span class="pplb7t-">tests/config.sqlite</span> file and not
  reading any configuration files. You can now try building your
  own configuration that matches this one or some others.
